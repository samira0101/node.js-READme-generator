# README-generator

Building an README-genarator (project)

# Description - Why did build a README genarator?
The main purpose to build a README genarator is so that the user can build a README file within the terminal.
The README file is a vital document which developors should use in order to understand the instructions/information provided. 

This project has not only enhanced my skills in javascript but the introduction to node and using the command line in the terminal has opened a new world of using the programme. Additional knowledge gained includes: Node (inquirer), writeFile, promise, init, prompt, .then, .catch on top of previous acquired javascript skills.

# What does this project do?

The user is able to respond to the questions asked in the terminal which then generates a README file based on their answers. This permits a developer to make continues changes to their code whilst updating the README simultaneously. Advantages for developers to use the README generator are that this is a quicker and easier way to make changes but also creates a professional outlook on their portfolio.

# Criteria set to achieve this?
```md
GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
WHEN I am prompted for information about my application repository
THEN a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with the title of my project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions

WHEN I enter my project title
THEN this is displayed as the title of the README

WHEN I enter a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions
THEN this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests

WHEN I choose a license for my application from a list of options
THEN a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under

WHEN I enter my GitHub username
THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to my GitHub profile

WHEN I enter my email address
THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach me with additional questions

WHEN I click on the links in the Table of Contents
THEN I am taken to the corresponding section of the README
```
